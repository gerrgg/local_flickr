# Local Flickr

Remember way back in the warm-up when you played with the Flickr API? Now it’s time for you to actually use it. Huzzah! You’ll create a simple photo widget that allows you to display photos from your Flickr feed (or someone else’s). We’ll rely on a tutorial for much of the heavy lifting but the principles of what you do here will be repeatable for use with other APIs.
